Cooler3D made mods for some games, and all its mods it delivers in the archive "4MODS".

To find out which mods in the archive and put the particular desired was a problem. So for Ultra it was decided to move them to a convenient menu in the form of a list where you can download any desired mod separately.

The Zelda and Astral Chain mods are not made by Cooler3D, but are made from patches/cheats community. Zelda pack is assembled Cooler3D, the Astral Chain pack is assembled redraz.
